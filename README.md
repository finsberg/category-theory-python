# Category Theory for python programmers

This is my attempt to implement some of the common structures from Category theory in python. Note that I am a beginner in Category theory and will use this repo as way to learn it. 

Topics to be covered are

- [ ] Moniod (in progress)
- [ ] Functors
- [ ] Applicative Functors
- [ ] Monads

This list might be more detailed in the future.
